# ZPA ZE110 meter reading using IEC 62056-21 with ESPHOME

## tl;dr

Reading PREdistribuce ZPA ZE110 powre meter from 2009 data to into Home Assistant<br>
Buy the HW, copy the example code, you're good to go

## HW Used: 

- [ESP32-C3 MINI](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mKSMj9N)
- [TTL to IR Infrared IEC62056 optical probe](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mqWDXiR) (too lazy to hack this together and I needed to have at least "not a bomb" look for my apartment building)
- random headers from bottom of my parts drawer, but you can solder the 4 wires directly

If anything is sold out, use the keyword to find similar parts

###  HW example ESP32C3 Supermini

### Pinout 
```
## ESP32 - IR head
GND    - GND black
3V3    - VCC red
GPIO20 - RXD yellow
GPIO21 - TXD white
```

# The long read

This example exposes values which I was interested in during my research, always check with your energy distributor what's allowed to be read by the consumer

These serial settings are the main thing you will need to make metter talk to you
```
  baud_rate: 300
  data_bits: 7
  stop_bits: 1
  parity: EVEN
```

There is a IEC handshake required, the meter will simply not spit out the information like some newer models. 
I hacked together a handshake reply according to this [blog post](https://www.gurux.fi/Gurux.DLMS.Iec#ModeECPlusPlus&quot)

```
/XXXZ Ident and a new line
XXX is the manufacturer name
Z is the maximum baud rate
Ident is the Identification info of the device.
Values of Z are:
0 - 300 Bd
1 - 600 Bd
2 - 1 200 Bd
3 - 2 400 Bd
4 - 4 800 Bd
5 - 9 600 Bd
6 - 19200Bd
7, 8, 9 - reserved for later extensions.
```

- First you need to send ``/?!\r\n``
- Then the meter will introduce itself  ``/ZPA4ZE110.v20_003\r\n``
- I was too lazy to implement baud rate switching, so despite support for 4800baud, we continue reading at default 300 ``\x06100\r\n``

All data is read within 19 seconds, this should be enough for comfortable 30 second refresh rate.

As the meter only reports whole numbers, I added two ``template`` sensors to calculate VA (U x I) and Watts (U x I x phase)

## Total energy for energy usage

The reported total value is missing unit for T1 and is overall imprecisse, rounded up to whole kWh.

To get more precision for Home Assisntats energy usage tab, I pool current consumption values and compute the values instead. <br>
You can hide the volts, amps and power factor, they are only used to compute the resulting Watts.

1. Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers tab.
2.	Click + Create Helper > Integration - Riemann sum integral.
3.	Name it something like "Total Energy Consumption".
4.	Choose the "esphome T1 (Watts)" computed consumption sensor as the input sensor.
5.	Set the Method to trapezoidal for better accuracy.
6.	Choose Unit Prefix as k (for kWh).
7.	Set Unit of Measurement to kWh.
8.  Set accuracy to 3 decimal points
